# Investment & Research Thesis

1. **Market Inefficiencies Persist** – Even in increasingly efficient crypto‑asset markets, micro‑structure frictions and behavioral biases create short‑lived pricing dislocations ripe for systematic capture.

2. **Data is Alpha** – Competitive advantage stems from proprietary data pipelines, custom low‑latency research infrastructure, and automated model deployment.

3. **Risk is a First‑Class Metric** – Position sizing, draw‑down controls, and scenario stress‑tests are embedded at every layer of the stack.

4. **Engineering Leverage** – Multi‑region Kubernetes clusters, Go & Rust micro‑services, and hardware‑accelerated research enable sub‑millisecond signal latency.
